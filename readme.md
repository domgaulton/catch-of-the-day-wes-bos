## Tips

### Lesson 1
* Use npm start to run the project
* React Developer tools for Chrome

### Lesson 2
* React Developer tools - Open Instagram or Facebook and go to React tab. Update state and see it change everywhere on page. State can have arrays with repeatable objects etc

### Lesson 3
* render function from ReactDom is a smaller function than all of ReactDom.render function normally required
* Split methods and functions into components
* export default StorePicker;
* import StorePicker into index.js

###Â Lesson 4
* JSX introduction - you could use `react.CreateElement(p, {className='class-name'}, 'Lorem Ipsum')` but instead we can use JSX by using the render and return methods render() { return (...)}
* `{ /* Comments in JSX */ }`


### Lesson 5
* Adding css styles via index.js. Better than doing it via public html as you can split your component styles
